The inner layer of the shell is made of \"nacre,\" or \"mother-of-pearl,\" and, hoo, what a dazzling iridescent hue! Let this be a lesson! You mustn't judge a sea snail by the outside of its shell.

But truth be told, baby barnacles are avid travelers, drifting shell-less about the sea before settling down. Once they find a good rock to affix themselves to, they float free no more. Which begs the question... Do adult acorn barnacles ever look out across the open sea...and long for youthful adventure once more?",

Though they can grow up to 12 feet from claw to claw and weigh up to 40 pounds, they're said to be docile. In fact, these gentle giants love to hide, attaching seaweed and sponges to their shell as camouflage. My feathers, if only I could unsee the SPIDER in the spider crab... I'm sure I'd find it charming as can be.",

        "description": "Whelks are sea snails that migrate from deep water to shallow water when the weather changes. Avid carnivores, they feed on worms, crustaceans, and mollusks. In fact, these wily snails have been known to use their own shells to pry open the shells of their victims! They then use a rough tongue-like organ with thousands of tiny teeth to lick their victims' shells clean. Eh... you might want to put that image out of your mind when it's your turn to dine.",
